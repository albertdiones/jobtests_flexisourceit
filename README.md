# jobtests_flexisourceit
A coding test from one of the job openings


Basically a product management tool with login requirements

Most noteable is that it requires that each tenant, which are probably clients, to have their own database.
I missed the part where they provided a remote db so I created my own. And also database are created dynamically.

Since I haven't created Symfony application from scratch, I had to google most of these. Most source are commented.
Most of the things that I commented on usually using hash(#) are things I did for expedience
